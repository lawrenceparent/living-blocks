# Plant Project

































**This project explores the ways in which we can build with nature to increase the biodiversity in cities whilst also developing our connection to nature. Through interviewing Rachel White, an expert in ecology and conservation, I discovered that in order to increase biodiversity in cities we need to make green spaces more wild and connect them through stepping stones or ‘green corridors’. I am exploring methods of creating a material that can be both built with and support plant and insect life.**
